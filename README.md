# Public Health & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Allie Skinner, a biology and public health graduate with a passion for using data to drive real-world health impact. This portfolio showcases interactive and insightful data science projects focused on public health, epidemiology, and biostatistics.

After taking time off to raise a family, I'm diving back into the field—combining my academic background, life experience, and growing technical skills to make a difference in healthcare analytics and data-driven decision-making.

### What You'll Find Here
- **Exploratory data analysis** on real-world health datasets
- **Interactive dashboards** and visualizations
- **Machine learning models** for health outcome prediction
- **Biostatistics deep-dives** and case studies
- Projects relevant to **Israel's health landscape** and global public health challenges

### Tools I Use
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub
- Streamlit / Tableau (coming soon!)

### Projects

- **[Exploring Health Risk Factors in Simulated Patient Data](https://github.com/alliejskinner/public-health-portfolio/blob/main/eda_public_health_notebook.ipynb)**  
  A beginner-friendly exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a fictional public health dataset. This notebook examines relationships between BMI, smoking, age, and diabetes, using visualizations and simple statistics to draw key insights.
